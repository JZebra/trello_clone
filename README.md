###Concept:

This is a clone of Trello, the productivity app by Fog Creek. I've tried to make it as faithful of a clone as possible, only changing the color scheme. 

###Primary Functionality:

The heart of Trello is in the boards. A user can have many boards. Once they navigate to a board, they can see its lists and the cards in those lists. The cards are moveable within lists and between lists on the same board. 

###Bugs:

- Comparator doesn't sort lists or cards.
- Once comparator is fixed, pare down render listeners to only what is needed.

###To do:

- Boards are shareable.
- Boards update in real time, similar to a google doc.
